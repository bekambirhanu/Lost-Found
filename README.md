Supabase: For the backend, including:
    PostgreSQL Database: For storing application data.

üöÄ Getting Started (Using the Pre-built APK)


Go to the Releases section of this GitHub repository .
Look for the app-release.apk (or similar name).
Download the latest APK file to your Android device.

Enable "Install from Unknown Sources":
On your Android device, you might need to enable the "Install from unknown sources" or "Allow apps from unknown sources" option in your device's security settings to install APKs not from the Google Play Store. The exact path varies by Android version and manufacturer:
    Android 8.0 (Oreo) and higher: Go to Settings > Apps & notifications > Special app access > Install unknown apps. Select your browser (or file manager app) and toggle "Allow from this source" on.
    Older Android versions: Go to Settings > Security and check the "Unknown sources" box.

Install the APK:
Locate the downloaded APK file using your device's file manager or the "Downloads" section in your browser.
Tap the APK file to begin the installation process.
Follow the on-screen prompts to install the application.

üíª Building from Source (For Developers)

If you wish to modify the application, contribute, or connect it to your own Supabase project, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

  Flutter SDK: Make sure you have Flutter installed and configured. Follow the official Flutter installation guide: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
  Android Studio / VS Code: An IDE with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
  Git: For cloning the repository.
  Supabase Account: You'll need a Supabase project set up for your backend.

Setup & Run

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/Erga1/Lost-Found.git
cd Lost-Found

Get Flutter dependencies:
Bash

    flutter pub get

Set up Supabase Environment Variables:
  Create a .env file in the root of your project to store your Supabase project URL and anonymous public key:

  SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

  (If you use a package like flutter_dotenv, follow its specific setup instructions to load these variables into your app.)
  Database Schema: Ensure your Supabase database tables (e.g., posts, users), authentication, and storage buckets (post_images) are correctly configured in your Supabase project.
  RLS Policies: Verify your Row Level Security (RLS) policies are correctly configured on your Supabase tables.

Run the app from your IDE:
  Open the project in Android Studio or VS Code.
  Select your target device/emulator/simulator.
  Click the "Run" button (or use flutter run in the terminal).
  The app will build and install on your selected device/emulator/simulator.
